# Data Structures and Algorithms in Java (Apna College)

This repository contains my solutions for the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) course taught by Apna College.  I'm working through the course materials and implementing the concepts in Java.  This README will help you navigate the repository and understand the code.

## Course Overview

The Apna College DSA course covers fundamental data structures and algorithms, providing a strong foundation for problem-solving and software development.  The course typically includes topics such as:

* **Basic Concepts:** Time and Space Complexity, Big O Notation
* **Data Structures:** Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, Heaps, AVL Trees, etc.), Graphs, Hash Tables
* **Algorithms:** Searching (Linear Search, Binary Search), Sorting (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort), Graph Traversal (BFS, DFS), Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, Backtracking

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by topic, with each folder containing code implementations and related notes.
